## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I started in law, pivoted into finance, and am now diving into code!

I took Python and C++ as general electives during my undergraduate years and didnâ€™t think much of it at the time. Years later, I became interested in coding after exploring CFA topics (ML, big data) and automating tasks with Apple Shortcuts, and unexpectedly fell in love with it. So, here I am! 

***I'm a total beginner, so please feel free to chime in or offer feedback at any time!***

### Iâ€™m looking for help with:

- Learning ML/AI & Data Science as a non-CS major
- Cooperating on beginner-friendly open-source projects in quant finance, risk modelling, or data tools
- Utilising lightweight apps combining automation, finance, and accessibility

  Market research, market mapping, and navigating financial/legal databases like Refinitiv, LexisNexis, Westlaw, DART (KR), Companies House (UK), ACRA (SG), and the SEC (US).
